        <h2 class="privacy">Our Policy</h2>
        <p class="privacyparagrapgh">Welcome to the web site (the “Site”) of Bento, a UseBento, LLC. product (“Bento”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”). This Site is operated by Bento and has been created to provide information about our company and our software-as-a-service platform for hiring designers and software developers and managing software development projects and related services (together with the Site, the “Services”) to our Service visitors (“you”, “your”). This Privacy Policy sets forth Bento’s policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”) and other information that is collected from visitors to the Site and Services.</p>
        <h2 class="privacy">Information We Collect</h2>
        <p class="privacyparagrapgh">When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below: &nbsp;
          <br>
          <br>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register for access to the Services or use certain Services. Wherever Bento collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.
          <br>
          <br>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Bento and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.
          <br>
          <br> Other Information:
          <br>
          <br>Non-Identifiable Data: When you interact with Bento through the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Bento may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Bento affiliates, agents or service providers. The Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.
          <br>
          <br>In operating the Services, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Service features. &nbsp;
          <br>
          <br> Aggregated Personal Data: In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Bento often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Bento may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Bento may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes. &nbsp;
          <br>
          <br> Third Party Tracking and Analytics: We may allow third party service providers to use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following your use of the Services. For example, we may use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), and Mixpanel, a mobile and web analytics platform provided by Mixpanel, Inc. (“Mixpanel”). Google and Mixpanel use cookies or similar technologies to help us analyze how users function and use our mobile applications and the Site to improve our Service. We may also implement Google Analytics features based on Display Advertising (which may include Remarketing with Google Analytics). Visitors can opt out by using Google’s Ads Settings or going to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/. To opt-out of Mixpanel’s collection of your data, go to https://mixpanel.com/optout/. Please note that if you get a new computer, install a new browser, erase or otherwise alter your browser's cookie file (including upgrading certain browsers) you may also clear the Mixpanel opt-out cookie.</p>
